# Next js one-page task

Run these to compile and run the code

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

If theres issue with initial installation,_remove_ the node_modules, package.lock, and _temporarily remove_ the .gitignore and .npmignore to fix this issue, run `npm i` again, and check the result.

Use these to run it as static server using static server libraries, i'm using 'now'

```
npm run export
cd out
now
```
